# Sponsor wIoT Development

wIoT is an MIT licensed open source project and completely free to use. However, the amount of effort needed to maintain and develop new features for the project is not sustainable without proper financial backing.

If you run a business and are using wIoT in a revenue-generating product, it makes business sense to sponsor wIoT development: it ensures the project that your product relies on stays healthy and actively maintained.

If you are an individual user and have enjoyed the productivity of using wIoT, consider donating as a sign of appreciation - like buying me coffee once in a while :)

You can support wIoT development via the following methods:

##Connect your device to D1 MINI
After burning the firmware, you should try to connect your device to D1 MINI      
Follow the steps below, I'm sure it would not be a problem for such a smart person like you     

###1. Reset your D1 MINI
Find pin **D0** on your D1 MINI, it should be in the middle of A0 and D5.      
Use a wire to connect **3V3** to **D0**. If your MINI works normally, you would see its BUILT-IN LED blink.    
You **don't** have to wait until it stops blink, just stay for **2s**, then you can pull out the wire and your MINI would reset.   

###2.Find your D1 MINI on your device
After you finish step 1, your MINI would work in AP mode, which means you can search it with your smart phone or personal computer by scanning the Wi-Fi around     
If your MINI was reset successfully, you would find a Wi-Fi with SSID in the form of **wiot-xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx**.     
Example:

"xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx" is the MAC address of this MINI, please try to remember the address for you may use it later   
The default password for D1 MINI is **1234567890**, enter the password and you should be able to connect to your MINI.

##Connect D1 MINI to your Wi-Fi
Congratulations, you have successfully connect your device to D1 MINI        
However, this is not the end, you should now try to connect D1 MINI to your Wi-Fi          
Use the device which had just been connected to D1 MINI and follow the steps below            
                   
###1. Visit the control page of D1 MINI
Visit **http://192.168.0.1** with the browser on your device             
Normally, you would see a webpage like this:          
![altÎÄ±¾](amWiki/images/webpage.png "Title")            
In this page, you can see the MAC Address and wIoT version of your MINI  
Again, please **remember** the MAC Address                 
              
###2. Submit SSID and password to your MINI         
From the page, you can see two blanks that ask the SSID and password of your Wi-Fi            
Input information of the Wi-FI which you would like to connect your MINI, click *Submit*             
If you have input the right SSID and password, you will see a page showing the message: **Set Successfully!! Rebooting!!**         
Then, after a minute, you will see the SSID of D1 MINI has vanished               
                  
If you submitted the wrong message, do not try to directly reconnect to D1 MINI.  Restart the whole procedure from the reset part of the last section

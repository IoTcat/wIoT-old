# wIoT

## Introduction
An Easy Programming Framework for IoT on WIFIduino.<br/>
wIoT let developers do not need to consider how to program the MCU and how the server could interact with MCUs. Then you can concentrate on programing the logic layer and develop very great IoT applications!  

## Demo
A simple demo can be accessed from http://home.yimian.xyz</br>
In this demo page, instant data collected from WIFIduinos are displayed while they are inserted into database.</br>
There are also several interact buttons. However, I strongly recommend that<font color="#A52A2A"> `do not click` </font>it, since this cloud disturb people using this system. <br/>
In the near future, I will prepare a suitable demo so that you can enjoy it as you wish.
